# Wynn Raid Reporter

Simple fabric client mod that relays any Wynncraft guild raid completion to a discord webhook via
[Ktor server](https://github.com/otcathatsya/wynn-raid-relay).<br>
You will need to install the server and enter its URL via this mod's in-game settings.
Also requires [Fabric Lang Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/versions).

Feel free to suggest changes or improvements!<br>
